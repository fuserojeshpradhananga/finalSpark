# Spark Notebook - Data Analysis and PostgreSQL Integration

This Jupyter Notebook contains Spark-based data analysis tasks and demonstrates how to integrate Spark with PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval. Below are the tasks and their respective solutions.

## Task 1: Calculate Average Seasonal Prices

**Question**: Calculate the average seasonal prices for a dataset containing date and price information, while also assigning each date a season label based on the month.

**Answer**: The notebook provides code to calculate seasonal averages, assign season labels, and write the final table into a PostgreSQL database.

## Task 2: Find Distance between Locations

**Question**: Find the distance between the locations with the minimum and maximum prices in a dataset.

**Answer**: The notebook demonstrates how to compute the distance between locations with minimum and maximum prices and how to write the resulting table into a PostgreSQL database.

## Task 3: Calculate Average Daily Prices and Pivot Table

**Question**: Calculate the average prices for each day of the month and present the results in a pivot table.

**Answer**: The notebook contains code for calculating daily averages and creating a pivot table. It also shows how to write the resulting table into a PostgreSQL database.
